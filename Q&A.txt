Q1. What do curly braces denote in C? Why does it make sense to use curly braces to surround the body of a function?

A1. The curly braces denote a block of code, in which variables can be declared. Variables declared within the block are valid
    only until the end of the block, marked by the matching right curly brace '}'. The body of a function is one such type of
    block, and thus, curly braces are used to describe the extent of that block.
    
Q2. Describe the difference between the literal values 7, "7", and '7'.

A2. The first literal describes an integer of value 7. The second describes a null-terminared string consisting of the character
    '7'. The third describes the character '7', whose value is its ASCII character code (55).
    
Q3. Consider the statement
    double ans = 10.0 + 2.0 / 3.0 - 2.0 * 2.0;
    Rewrite this statement, inserting parentheses to ensure that ans = 11.0 upon evaluation of this statement.
    
A3. double ans = 10.0 + 2.0 / ((3.0 - 2.0) * 2.0);
